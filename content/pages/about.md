I am a young person with a lot of enthuasiasm about technologies and specially its possible use for people's daily life improvement. I love travelling and meeting people all over the world. I am also interested in history of art :)

Currently, I am starting to develop apps for Android on my own, learning how the Android app architecture can be structured, how to manage threads, implementing a UI following the Material Design guidelines and integrating all the Jetpack components in my apps.
